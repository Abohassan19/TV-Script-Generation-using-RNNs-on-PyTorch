# TV Script Generation

In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.


## The Road Ahead

* Explore the Data
* Implement Pre-processing Functions
* Build and Train the RNN
* Hyperparameters Tuning
* Generate TV Scripts

jerry:...

jerry: i don't think so.

elaine: i thought i would have a good time, i know. it's a misprint.

kramer: well, it's a big mistake!

hoyt: so you have no idea what the problem is in the bubble.

jerry: what?

george: i know.

elaine: you know, you have a good idea.

george: oh, i can't do it.

george: you want to get a job?

elaine: i can't.

jerry: i can't do this!

elaine: what?

elaine: i know, i don't have it to get to know.

hoyt: i thought he liked me.

jerry: what?

jerry: you don't know how the new woman has ever done that. i don't know why you don't want to talk with this guy, and i was wondering if it was an accident.

george: what? what is that?

george: oh, it's my fault.

jerry: you know, it's not a problem.

jerry: you want to be a liar.

elaine: oh, yeah!

jerry: what?

jerry: no, it's a very important time.

jerry: i don't know.

elaine: you can't get the hell out of my office.

jerry: what are you doing?

jerry: no, i don't know how you're going to be.

jerry: what is the problem with you?

kramer: oh, no, no. no. no, no. no. no. no, no. it's a little rough.

george: i know.

jerry: i don't know. it's just a problem. i don't want to get a piece of cake!

hoyt: i have to get the feeling of it.

george: what?

jerry: i think it was a little messy.

elaine: oh, no. no, no. no- no. no,
